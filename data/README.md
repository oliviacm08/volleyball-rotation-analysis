# Data Directory

This folder contains all datasets used in the Volleyball Rotation Efficiency Analysis project.  
It is divided into **raw data** and **processed data**, including inputs and outputs for the Markov-chain simulation model.

---

##  1. Raw Data (`raw/`)

Contains rally-level data extracted from **real men’s professional volleyball matches**.

### Includes:
- Individual match CSV files  
- Combined raw dataset (`real_matches_combined.csv`)  
- Rotation reference table (`rotation_positions.csv`) mapping zones → player positions and rotations

Raw data is kept unchanged. All cleaning, formatting, and metric extraction occur in `processed/`.

---

## 2. Processed Data (`processed/`)

Contains derived datasets used to configure the simulation model and outputs of the simulations.

### Subfolders:

#### **`simulation_inputs/`**
Datasets generated from raw matches that serve as inputs to the Markov-chain simulation.  
Includes:
- Rotation metrics per team  
- Serve type probabilities per team

#### **`simulated_matches/`**
Outputs generated by the simulation:

- Rally-by-rally simulated match files  
- Combined simulated dataset  
- Team-level simulated scoring logs

> Rotation efficiency tables and other aggregated metrics derived from the simulations are included in the `analysis/` directory, along with the corresponding plots.

##Notes

- Only datasets used as inputs to the simulation or generated by the simulation appear here.  
- Aggregated analyses, rotation efficiency comparisons, and visualizations live in the **`analysis/`** folder.  
- If new matches or simulations are added, place them in the appropriate subfolder.
