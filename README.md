# 🏐 Volleyball Rotation Efficiency Analysis

This project analyzes rotation-specific performance in men’s professional volleyball using both simulated and real rally-level data. It focuses on how serving patterns, pass quality, and rotation matchups influence side-out probability and overall scoring efficiency.

## Objectives
- Measure **rotation efficiency** across real and simulated matches  
- Analyze **serve type distributions** per rotation and per team  
- Compare **simulated vs real match** rotation and serve patterns  
- Evaluate **side-out and pass quality** by rotation  
- Provide transparent, reproducible code and visualizations

## Repository Structure
