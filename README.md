# Volleyball Rotation Efficiency Analysis

This project investigates rotation-specific performance in **men’s professional volleyball** using both **real and simulated rally-level data**. It focuses on how serving patterns, rotation matchups, and pass quality affect side-out probability and overall scoring efficiency.

---

## Project Overview

- Analyze **rotation efficiency** and **serve type distributions** across real and simulated matches  
- Use **Markov chain modeling** to simulate match outcomes and evaluate strategic serving/rotation choices  
- Compare simulated vs. real data to validate model performance  
- Focus on metrics critical to point scoring: rotation efficiency, serve performance (ace%, error%, in-play%), pass quality, and team-specific serve distributions

## Tools

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) — main processing, simulation, and plotting  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — exploratory analysis (optional; primary workflow in scripts)  
- **GitHub** — version control and reproducibility  

---

## Repository Structure

- **data/** — raw and processed match datasets (real and simulated)  
- **scripts/** — preprocessing, simulation, and plotting code  
- **analysis/** — visualizations and analytical outputs (comparison and real-only metrics)  
- **docs/** — research paper drafts and final version  

All scripts are fully reproducible with the provided data.
